-- Adding user-defined mappings to 'Plugin' mode for third-party plugins --

To start adding mappings to 'Plugin' mode copy the file 'user_defined_plugin_mappings.py' to the `user` folder

Please note, when the script is updated by FL Studio the `user` folder will be overwritten. In order to not lose
the user-defined mappings please keep a copy in another location.

To add support for a plugin, add a mapping entry to the list specified by
the 'plugin_mappings' field in that file.

A mapping has the following fields:
    "plugin_name"       - [required] name used by FL Studio (See plugins.getPluginName)
    "parameters"        - [required] list of up to eight parameters

A parameter has the following fields:
    "parameter_index"   - [required] index used by FL Studio (See plugins.getParamCount and plugins.getParamName)
    "name"              - [optional] name that will be shown instead of default name (See plugins.getParamName)
    "center"            - [optional] value from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating the 'center' deadzone

An empty pair of curly braces `{}` indicates no parameter assigned to the control at that position.

``` Example of a simple mapping
{
    "plugin_name": "NameOfExamplePlugin",
    "parameters": [
        {"parameter_index": 0},
        {"parameter_index": 1},
    ],
}
```
